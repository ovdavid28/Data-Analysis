###NYC Taxi Dataset###

The first assignment is to answer some basic questions about a sample of the "NYC Taxi Dataset". The URLs were taken from https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data/.

Notice that, even though we will use only a subset, this needs around 2 GB of RAM, plus a margin to do the analysis! if your computer is not capable enough, you can use https://colab.research.google.com/, which gives you a Jupyter installation with 12 GB of RAM for free.

Load https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2017-10.csv into pandas, using an appropriate column as an index and parsing the columns that have dates
Display the first 5 rows, a statistical summary, and the dtypes of the columns
Do you find any inconsistency in fares or distance data? If so, remove them from the dataset
Try to plot a histogram of the trip distance distribution. What happens? Try increasing the number of bins, normalizing the data, or using a logarithmic scale in the Y axis to actually see something
What is the median trip distance per passenger count? Represent it in text and graphical form
Create a new column payment_type_text that is 'Cash' if payment_type is 2 and 'Other' otherwise
Bonus points: what is the correlation between leaving no tip and paying with cash?
The grading will be as follows: 0.5 points for each correct answer above, and 1 extra point for overall presentation, aesthetics, code quality and originality. Yes: the maximum theoretical grade is thus 4.5 out of 4, but only 4 points will be awarded.

The format of the delivery must be a Jupyter notebook that should run, top to bottom, without errors on a capable computer with Python 3.6. It should include explanations in the form of text cells, and code comments where appropriate.
