We will use the data from this competition https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/1/united-nations-millennium-development-goals/.

    1.Load the data from the competition, removing any possible meaningless column.
    2.The "Series Code" column contains codes with segments separated by periods ".". Suppose that the first segment represents some global "category". How many unique categories are?
    3.Write a function that receives a country name and returns a pandas DataFrame indexed by year with all the series as columns. Write another similar function that receives a series name and returns the countries.
    4.Plot the "Alternative and nuclear energy (% of total energy use)" of your three countries in the same plot, as well as a centered, 3 year rolling mean.
    5.Which are the 8 countries with the largest "Electricity production from coal sources (kWh)"? Plot the series for those 8 countries.
    6.Among the countries that had a nonzero "Electricity production from coal sources (kWh)" in each of the last 5 years of the dataset, which are the 8 ones that had the biggest percentual increase in those last 5 years? Plot the series for those 8 countries.
    7.Pick some health or development indicators of your choice. "Is the world doing better or worse?". Discuss, compare different countries and/or continents, correlate with other indexes.
