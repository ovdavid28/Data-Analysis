Exercise: TF-IDF

    1.Write a function tf that receives a string and a spaCy Doc and returns the number of times the word appears in the lemmatized Doc
    2.Write a function idf that receives a string and a list of spaCy Docs and returns the inverse of the number of docs that contain the word
    3.Write a function tf_idf that receives a string, a spaCy Doc and a list of spaCy Docs and returns the product of tf(t, d) Â· idf(t, D).
    4.Write a function all_lemmas that receives a list of Docs and returns a set of all available lemmas
    5.Write a function tf_idf_doc that receives a Doc and a list of Docs and returns a dictionary of {lemma: TF-IDF value}, corresponding to each the lemmas of all the available documents
    6.Write a function tf_idf_scores that receives a list of Docs and returns a DataFrame displaying the lemmas in the columns and the documents in the rows.
