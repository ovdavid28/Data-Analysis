This assignment builds upon the work we did during the visualization session. Starting from the basic scatter 
plot that we did (life expectancy versus fertility, colored by region, and with bubble size proportional to population), 
do the following:

1.Decorate the figure with proper X and Y axis labels, a title, a big text showing the year, and a legend (if not present).
Note: If the legend does not show the colors, upgrade plotly to the latest version

2.Create a function update_year that receives a year as an integer and updates the data of the existing figure with 
the values from the selected year. Note: The update might not be very efficient

3.Create an horizontal slider that ranges from the minimum to the maximum year

4.Bind the update_year function to changes in the horizontal slider and use it to interactively change the plot
